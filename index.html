    <h1>The story of Salmon Cookies!</h1>
    <article>
        Cookies appear to have their origins in 7th century AD Persia, shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region. They spread to Europe through the Muslim conquest of Spain. ... The Dutch word "koekje" was Anglicized to "cookie" or cooky.

        But... our great and delicious cookies came from the unusual and pretty look for the salmon it's really amazing, don't worry it's just like real cookies but with different shapes!
